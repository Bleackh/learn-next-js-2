## What is React JS

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and React for additional features and optimizations.

Under the hood, React JS also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for JavaScript, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, React JS can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast JavaScript applications.
